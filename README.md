#HOW TO BUILD THE PROJECT
.

.
I have provided a precompiled Windows executable binary in the bin folder but in case you'd like to compile the project yourself I an executable jar that is ready to be packaged into any package of your choice. In the \out\artifacts\Weathry_jar you'd find a bat file, the bat file assumes you have javaFx mods in the following directory C:\Program Files\Java\javafx-jmods-22.0.2 - if not change it.
